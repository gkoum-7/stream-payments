# Payment Streams

Imagine if payments could be made every millisecond instead of being sent at the end of a week or a month or a quarter. `Payment Streams` allows users to stream funds to another account. 

- Developer sets up a payment streaming smart contract

- A payer (Sender), creates a stream by depositing funds in the contract and chooses a streaming duration.

- A payee (Recipient), can withdraw money from stream equivalent to the amount of money streamed since stream creation

- The stream can be terminated by either the sender or recipient

- The sender or recipient can check the balance in the stream at any time

Develop the idea and test all functions in any possible way.
